The last piece in the puzzle is the supporting [Microservice](https://github.com/jekyll-store/microservice). It's responsible for running code that really can't be safely run on the customers computer: processing payments, double-checking the numbers add up, sending emails...etc Currently it's written with the [Sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra) web-framework.
