All the javascript business logic that's needed to get customers from the homepage through to purchase has been kept as isolated as possible from the implementation specifics and is housed in it's own repo [Engine](https://github.com/jekyll-store/engine). It is written with the [RefluxJS](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs) derivative of the [Flux](https://github.com/facebook/flux) architecture and which means all the data flows uni-directionally from actions to stores to components.
