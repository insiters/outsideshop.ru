The key innovation that makes the Jekyll-Store solution unique, is the [Front](https://github.com/jekyll-store/front) component of the solution. It avoids the complexity of a traditional ecommerce solution by keeping the data that forms the content of site: products, delivery-methods, countries...etc; as simple datafiles in the source repository.

From there, it is compiled using [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) static site generator to create a front-end that is fast and responsive. As Jekyll is built-in to [Github](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages/), all you have to do is [fork](https://github.com/jekyll-store/front/fork) and you're already deployed.
